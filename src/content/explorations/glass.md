During the pre-iOS 26 beta hype cycle I experimented with liquid glass in the browser using Unicorn Studio.

The tool’s high level of granularity makes it easy to fine-tune how the glass looks and reacts to different backgrounds, allowing for deep manipulation of shape and light refraction.

### Finished product

With mouse tracking and a simple framer embed I was able to bring this site to life with a few clicks.
