                I'm obsessed with the 'why' behind digital experiences. For me, good design isn't about shipping features—it's about removing friction and rejecting manipulation. I want to build software that feels human, helpful, and properly optimized for the individual. The long term goal is simple: turn these ideas into a framework that others can use to build better, kinder tools.
